### Neural Networks and Deep Learning course by Andrew NG, Coursera

##### These notebooks are part of the course material/assignments. Highly recommend the course if you want to learn neural networks and deep learning concepts with basic python programming knowledge. The material and assignments drive you to write the code and build code blocks/functions one at a time and building the whole model at the end.
