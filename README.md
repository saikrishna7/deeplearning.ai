### The notebooks are part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course by Andrew NG taken on Coursera. Highly recommend the course if you want to learn neural networks and deep learning concepts with basic python programming knowledge. The material and assignments drive you to write the code and building blocks one at a time and building the whole model at the end.
